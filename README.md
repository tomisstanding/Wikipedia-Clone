# Project 2 - Wikipedia Clone
---
For my project 2 I decided to try and build a wikipedia clone that uses node.js with express and encorporates markdown for the content of the articles as well as a timestamp from when the article was created, for this I chose to use markdown and timestamp npm packages as well as many others.
